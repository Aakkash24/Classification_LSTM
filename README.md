### Deployment of Text Classification Project

Text classification using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a natural language processing (NLP) project that aims to build a machine learning model capable of automatically categorizing text data into predefined classes or categories. The project utilizes the power of LSTM, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to effectively process sequential data like sentences and paragraphs.
